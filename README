Anchors unify Search Engines and Bookmarks and can
be defined under ~/.config/shower/anchors as

   [Anchors]
   ?=http://duckduckgo.com/?kl=de-de&q=%s
   en=http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&search=%s


The dashboard is just a HTML file placed under
~/.config/shower/dashboard.html - an example is
provided.

The file ~/.config/shower/adblock can contain a
single regular expression to block URIs.


Dependencies:

Sadly, some distributions ship .vapi header files
that do not match the installed library versions.
You might have to generate your own ones.
