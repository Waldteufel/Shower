# shower
“eine Web-Brause”

_A small application around the WebKit engine, best served with a tiling Window Manager like i3._

I wrote the [first version](https://github.com/Waldteufel/shower/tree/gtk-vala) in 2011 and 2012 using Gtk and Vala.

A [second version](https://github.com/Waldteufel/shower/tree/gtk-python) in Python followed in 2014, but only contains a minimum of features.

This is the third iteration – also in Python, but this time using QWebEngine.
